# Intro

This package is a fork of [rust-mode](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-mode)

Differences with rust-mode:

- cargo popup
- multiline error parsing
- translation of ANSI control sequences through [xterm-color](https://github.com/atomontage/xterm-color)
- async org babel
- custom compilation process
- rustfmt errors in a rust compilation mode
- automatic RLS configuration with [eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) or [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode)
- cask for testing
- requires emacs 26
- etc.

Simply put `(use-package rustic)` in your config and most stuff gets configured automatically. 
If you have `rust-mode` installed, ensure it is required before rustic since it has to be removed
from `auto-mode-alist`.

# Org-babel

```
#+BEGIN_SRC rustic :crates '(("regex" . "0.2") ("darling" . "0.1"))
fn main() {
    println!("{}", "foo");
}
#+END_SRC
```

# Rust Language Server

The default package is `eglot`. But you can also use `lsp-mode` or no RLS client with `nil`.

``` emacs-lisp
(setq rustic-rls-pkg 'eglot)
```

# Popup

You can execute commands with `rustic-popup`. The list of commands can be customized
with `rustic-popup-commands`. It's also possible to view the command's flags with `h`.
The command `rustic-popup-default-action` (`RET` or `TAB`) allows you to change:

- `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable
- `compilation-arguments` for `recompile`
- arguments for `cargo test`

# Cargo outdated

Use `rustic-cargo-outdated` to get a list of dependencies that are out of date. The results 
are displayed in `tabulated-list-mode` and you can use most commands you know from the emacs
package menu.

- `u` mark single crate for upgrade
- `U` mark all upgradable crates
- `m` remove mark
- `x` perform marked package menu actions
- `r` refresh crate list
- `q` quit window
